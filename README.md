# Video Frame Extractor and Image Analysis Tool

Windows application for extracting frames from videos and analyzing them for sharpness, grading, and alignment for 3DGS purposes. This project was built almost entirely in the cursor composer by a non-programmer, so, don't judge me on the code quality. Open to feedback and suggestions for new features, improvements, and bug fixes. 

## Features

### Video Processing
- Extract frames from videos at customizable FPS rates
- Optional frame resizing while maintaining aspect ratio
- Progress tracking during extraction
- Support for common video formats (MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV)

### Image Analysis
- Automatic blur detection using Laplacian variance
- Batch processing of images
- Smart selection of best frames based on quality metrics
- Configurable minimum and maximum image selection
- Detailed statistics and analysis results

### Integration
- Direct integration with RealityCapture for 3D reconstruction
- Darktable integration for image grading
- Automatic project organization and file management

## Requirements

### Software Dependencies
- Python 3.7+
- FFmpeg (must be in system PATH)
- RealityCapture (optional, for 3D reconstruction)
- Darktable (optional, for image processing)

## Installation Guide

### Basic Installation

1. **Install Python**
   - Download Python 3.7+ from [python.org](https://python.org)
   - During installation, check "Add Python to PATH"
   - Verify installation:
   ```powershell
   python --version
   ```

2. **Install FFmpeg**
   - Download FFmpeg from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
   - Extract the zip file
   - Add FFmpeg to PATH:
     - Copy the path to ffmpeg/bin folder
     - Open System Properties → Advanced → Environment Variables
     - Add to System PATH
   - Verify installation:
   ```powershell
   ffmpeg -version
   ```

3. **Clone Repository**
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/shrimbly/Video-to-splat.git
   cd Video-to-splat
   ```

4. **Create Virtual Environment**
   ```powershell
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

5. **Install Dependencies**
   ```powershell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Config

1. **RealityCapture Integration**
   - Install RealityCapture
   - Update `config.py` with RC path:
   ```python
   RC_EXECUTABLE = r"C:\Program Files\Capturing Reality\RealityCapture\RealityCapture.exe"
   ```

2. **Darktable Integration**
   - Download Darktable from [darktable.org](https://darktable.org/install/)
   - Install and update `config.py`:
   ```python
   DARKTABLE_EXECUTABLE = r"C:\Program Files\darktable\bin\darktable.exe"
   ```

3. **Configure Output Directories**
   - Open `config.py`
   - Set your preferred paths:
   ```python
   AUTOMATIC_OUTPUT_DIR = r"path\to\your\output\directory"
   SOURCE_IMAGES_DIR = "Source Images"
   BEST_IMAGES_DIR = "Best Images"
   ```
**Run it**
   Do the config first, then run it. 
   ```powershell
   python main.py
   ```
### Troubleshooting

1. **FFmpeg Not Found**
   - Ensure FFmpeg is in PATH
   - Restart terminal/IDE after PATH changes
   - Try using full path in config

2. **Import Errors**
   - Verify virtual environment is activated
   - Reinstall requirements:
   ```powershell
   pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Permission Issues**
   - Run terminal as administrator
   - Check folder permissions
   - Verify write access to output directories

4. **Video Processing Errors**
   - Ensure video codec is supported
   - Check available disk space
   - Verify video file isn't corrupted
